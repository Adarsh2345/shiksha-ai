# Shiksha AI: AI-Powered Teaching Assistant

## What is the idea about?

Shiksha AI is an intelligent, offline-first teaching assistant designed specifically for educators in low-resource and diverse linguistic environments, with an initial focus on India. It serves as a comprehensive toolkit that empowers teachers by automating and enhancing various aspects of their daily workflow, from planning lessons to creating customized learning materials for their students.

The platform provides a suite of AI-driven features accessible through a simple and intuitive interface, ensuring that even teachers with limited technical expertise can leverage the power of modern technology to enrich their teaching practices.

## What problem this tries to solve?

Educators in many parts of India and other developing regions face a unique set of challenges:

*   **Time Constraints:** Teachers are often overburdened with large class sizes and administrative tasks, leaving little time for creating tailored lesson plans or differentiated materials.
*   **Resource Scarcity:** Access to high-quality teaching aids, updated textbooks, and digital tools is often limited, especially in rural or underserved areas.
*   **Linguistic Diversity:** Creating educational content that is both accurate and culturally relevant in various local languages is a significant hurdle.
*   **Diverse Learning Needs:** In multi-grade classrooms, teachers struggle to create worksheets and activities that cater to students at different learning levels simultaneously.

Shiksha AI directly addresses these problems by providing tools to instantly generate lesson plans, create differentiated worksheets from a single textbook page, produce simple visual aids for blackboards, and explain complex concepts in local languages.

## Tech Stack being used
