# Shiksha AI: AI-Powered Teaching Assistant

## What is the idea about?

Shiksha AI is an intelligent teaching assistant for educators in low-resource environments. It's a toolkit to empower teachers by automating daily tasks like lesson planning and creating custom materials, accessible via a simple, intuitive interface.

## What problem this tries to solve?

Teachers in developing regions are often overburdened and lack resources. Shiksha AI tackles time constraints, resource scarcity, linguistic diversity, and the need for differentiated learning by providing instant, AI-powered educational tools.

## Tech Stack being used

Built on a modern stack: Next.js/React for the frontend, ShadCN UI & Tailwind CSS for styling, and Firebase for backend services. Genkit, integrated with Google's Gemini models, powers all AI-driven features for a robust and scalable solution.

## Impact of the solution

Shiksha AI boosts teacher efficiency by automating tasks, allowing more student focus. It improves educational quality with accessible, relevant content, enables personalized learning, and helps bridge the digital divide for educators in low-connectivity areas.
