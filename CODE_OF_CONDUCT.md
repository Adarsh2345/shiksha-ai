# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming project environment, we — the contributors and maintainers of **clienvy** — pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or economic status.

## Our Standards

We expect community members to follow these standards:

* Be respectful and considerate in all communications (issues, PRs, comments, chat, video calls).
* Assume good faith: give people the benefit of the doubt and avoid hostile language.
* Provide constructive feedback and accept it graciously.
* Use inclusive language — avoid slang or jokes that may exclude or alienate.
* Acknowledge and correct mistakes when they happen.
* Respect the maintainers' decisions about the project's direction and processes.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following are examples of unacceptable behavior and will not be tolerated:

* Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any kind.
* Derogatory comments or slurs related to identity (race, gender, sexual orientation, etc.).
* Personal insults, threats, or sustained harassment.
* Public or private shaming, doxxing, or revealing private information.
* Trolling, deliberately disruptive behavior, or spamming.
* Posting sexually explicit or violent content.
* Repeatedly opening low-quality or abusive issues/PRs after warnings.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the clienvy project, including but not limited to GitHub issues and pull requests, project discussion forums, chat channels, mailing lists, and in-person or virtual events organized by the project.

## Reporting and Enforcement

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it to the project maintainers. Reports can be submitted by:

* Opening a private issue (label it `private` or `mod` if your repository supports it), or
* Emailing the maintainers at **[maintainers@clienvy.dev](mailto:maintainers@clienvy.dev)** (replace with an active project email), or
* Contacting the repository owner directly on GitHub.

All reports will be treated seriously and handled with discretion. When you report, please include:

* A description of the incident and where it occurred (issue/PR link, chat transcript, date/time).
* Names or handles of the people involved (if known).
* Any screenshots or logs that help document the behavior.

Enforcement steps may include:

1. Private warning from maintainers.
2. Temporary suspension of contribution rights (blocking from repository interactions).
3. Removal from the project or permanent bans for severe or repeated violations.

Maintainers will determine the action to take and may consult other contributors when needed. If you are reporting a safety concern or feel you are in immediate danger, contact local authorities.

## Mediation

If a conflict cannot be resolved through normal reporting channels, maintainers may appoint neutral contributors to mediate. The goal is remediation and restoring a collaborative environment when possible.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant and other widely adopted open source community guidelines. It is intentionally concise to be easy to read — feel free to expand it to suit your project's needs.

## Contact and Revisions

If you have questions about this Code of Conduct or suggestions for improvements, please open an issue titled **"Code of Conduct: suggestion"** or email the maintainers at **[maintainers@clienvy.dev](mailto:maintainers@clienvy.dev)**.

This Code of Conduct was last updated on **October 5, 2025**. The maintainers reserve the right to update this document; substantive changes will be announced in the repository.
