## Core Features:

- Local Content Generation: Generates hyper-local content. Allowing a teacher to make requests in their local language and receive culturally relevant content powered by Gemini. The tool will attempt to incorporate analogies, farmer's tales, etc.
- Differentiated Worksheet Generation: Generates differentiated materials, so that, a teacher can upload a photo of a textbook page and instantly generate multiple versions of a worksheet tailored to different grade levels using a multimodal Gemini model.
- AI Knowledge Base: Serves as an instant knowledge base using simple, accurate explanations for complex student questions in the local language, complete with easy-to-understand analogies generated by Gemini.
- Visual Aid Generation: Generates simple line drawings or charts based on a teacher's description that can be easily replicated on a blackboard powered by Gemini. The tool will generate visualizations of processes (e.g. the water cycle), rather than decorative images.
- AI Lesson Planner: Create AI-powered weekly lesson planners that structure activities and save teachers valuable time.
- User-Friendly Interface: Easy navigation and accessibility, making it user-friendly for teachers with varying levels of tech proficiency.
